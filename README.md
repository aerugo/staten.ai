Staten is a desktop application that serves as an app marketplace for MCPs. It allows you to discover, install, and manage apps that extend the functionality of Claude Desktop and Cursor.

All without having to use a command line. Staten is made for non-technical users in mind, but is open-source and extensible so developers can make it their own.
